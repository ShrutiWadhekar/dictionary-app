{
    "id": 1,
    "name": "Java",
    "inventor": "James Gosling",
    "inventionyear": 1995,
    "description": "Java is a high-level, class-based, object-oriented programming language that is designed to have as few implementation dependencies as possible. Compiled Java code can run on all platforms that support Java without the need for recompilation.",
    "advantages": "Java is platform-independent.Java is a simple programming language since it is easy to learn and easy to understand. Java uses an object-oriented paradigm, which makes it more practical.",
    "disadvantages": "Verbose and Complex codes. Java program consumes more memory since it runs on top of Java virtual machine. Java provides automatic garbage collection.",

    "inventionyear": 2008,
    "description": "A blockchain is a decentralized ledger of all transactions across a peer-to-peer network.",
    "advantages": "Blockchain technology is highly secure because of the reason each and every individual who enters into the Blockchain network is provided with a unique identity which is linked to his account.",

    "id": 4,
    "name": "C",
    "inventor": "Dennis Ritchie",
    "inventionyear": 1970,
    "description": "C is a procedural programming language.Features of C are low-level memory access, a simple set of keywords, and a clean style, So it is suitable for system programmings like an operating system or compiler development.",
    "advantages": "C is a robust language as it contains many data types and operators. C is very flexible, or we can say machine independent that helps you to run your code on any machine.",
    "disadvantages": "C does not support the concept of OOPs. The errors or the bugs arenâ€™t detected after each line of code. Instead, the compiler shows all the errors after writing the program.",

{
    "id": 5,
    "name": "Cloud Computing",
    "inventor": "Joseph Carl Robnett Licklider",
    "inventionyear": 2006,
    "description": "Cloud computing is the on-demand availability of computer system resources, especially data storage (cloud storage) and computing power, without direct active management by the user.",
    "advantages": "Once the data is stored in the cloud, it is easier to get back-up and restore that data using the cloud. Cloud applications improve collaboration by allowing groups of people to quickly and easily share information in the cloud via shared storage.",
    "disadvantages": "cloud infrastructure is completely owned, managed, and monitored by the service provider, so the cloud users have less control over the function and execution of services within a cloud infrastructure.",

    "name": "DevOps",
    "inventor": "Patrick Debois",
    "inventionyear": 2009,
    "description": "DevOps is a set of practices that combines software development and IT operations. It aims to shorten the systems development life cycle and provide continuous delivery with high software quality.",
    "advantages": "It helps to detect any problems at the stage of coding. Automatic testing allows developers to fix the detected bugs as soon as possible without waiting for manual testing.",
    "disadvantages": "DevOps is not based on a few practices that you can adopt or abandon whenever desired. It is a complete framework, a work culture that cannot be simply implemented by following a Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC).",

    "inventor": "John McCarthy",
    "inventionyear": 1943,
    "description": "Artificial intelligence is the simulation of human intelligence processes by machines, especially computer systems. Specific applications of AI include expert systems, natural language processing, speech recognition and machine vision.",
    "advantages": "One of the biggest advantages of Artificial Intelligence is that it can significantly reduce errors and increase accuracy and precision.",
    "disadvantages": "A big disadvantage of AI is that it cannot learn to think outside the box. AI is capable of learning over time with pre-fed data and past experiences, but cannot be creative in its approach.",
